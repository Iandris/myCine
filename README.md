Elevator Pitch
	Ever loan a movie out to someone and canâ€™t remember if they brought it back or even who had it? MyCine is an online inventory of your home movie collection where you can sort by title, year, director, etc. Share your library list with your friends so they know what movies you have. MyCine will help you loan those movies out to your friends and family just like RedBox or Netflix. You can set loan periods, and send them reminders via text when their movies are due back.
